# File-Upload-Download

This template can be used by anyone in their website. Through this you can upload your files to the <b>MYSQL database</b>.
All you need is to create a folder with the name <b>uploads</b> in the folder where all the files are kept.

Also create a mysql database with name <b>"file-management"</b> and the table <b>"files" </b>thats it.

Any changes further to this are welcomed.
